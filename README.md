# python-monoapi

A monorepo for all my different Python APIs, built in Python. It uses [Robyn](https://github.com/sparckles/Robyn) as the main web framework.

## Why?

So then instead of cluttering up my domains with many different API urls for my different projects, I can just have one API that can route to all APIs.

## Services

- Pixiv (for [Picsiv](https://picsiv.hayasaka.moe/) usage)
